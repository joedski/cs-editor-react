CS Editor in React
==================

Simple CS editor so people don't have to sully their hands with BBCode.  Maybe some time I'll build some sort of schema support to make it easier to customize.  For now, the interface is ad-hoc.  For now, CSs are saved in local storage, not to a server, so it's recommended users periodically save their CSs to their computer for safe keeping.
